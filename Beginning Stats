## Why Materials Science :atom_symbol:

I’m fascinated by how **atomic structure → macroscopic performance**. From spacecraft alloys that shrug off re‑entry heat to flexible electrodes that read brain signals, materials power the future. This project is my proof that curiosity, grit, and modern AI tools can bridge the gap between “interested” and “expert.”

## Guiding Principles

1. **Consistency over intensity** – 22 h every week, no zero‑weeks.  
2. **Project‑first learning** – every concept ends in code, simulation, or a mini‑paper.  
3. **Open science** – all notes, data, and code live publicly in this repo.  
4. **AI as co‑researcher** – ChatGPT for debugging, literature TL;DR, and idea generation.
