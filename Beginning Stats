I’m a 24‑year‑old self‑learner beginning a two‑year journey to master PhD‑level Materials Science & Engineering. My formal academic record is modest—I completed high‑school coursework with ease but struggled in college, earning C’s in Calculus I and not passing Calculus II. I have foundational exposure to algebra, chemistry, and introductory calculus, and a recent IQ assessment placed me around 115 (solidly average).

Why materials science? I’m fascinated by how atomic‑scale structures translate into real‑world performance—everything from aerospace alloys to flexible electronics. This project is my personal proof‑of‑concept: with disciplined study, open‑source tools, and AI assistance, I can close the gap between curiosity and expertise, regardless of where I started.
