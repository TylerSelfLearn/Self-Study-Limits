# Two-Year Materials-Science Self-Study
**Mission**  
Leverage open‑source software, public data, and generative‑AI copilots to compress a PhD‑level Materials Science & Engineering (MSE) education into **24 months**.

**Why**  
1. Test how far disciplined self‑study + modern AI tools can push human learning speed.  
2. Build a public, reproducible portfolio of simulations, reports, and code that rivals early‑stage doctoral research.

**Core Objectives (2025 → 2027)**  
- Master the theoretical pillars of MSE: crystallography, thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanical & electronic properties.  
- Become fluent with computational tools: LAMMPS, OpenCalphad/pycalphad, ASE, FEniCS/Elmer, Quantum ESPRESSO, and materials‑informatics ML stacks.  
- Complete three specialization tracks:  
  1. **Spacecraft alloys** (lightweight, high‑temp, radiation‑resistant)  
  2. **Non‑invasive BCI electrode materials** (biocompatible, low‑impedance)  
  3. **Smart sensor materials** (flexible piezo/thermo‑electric films)  
- Publish ≥ 10 mini‑papers + 1 integrative review on arXiv; present at least one virtual conference.

**Repo Layout**  
notes/ Markdown summaries of every lecture & paper
projects/ Code, input files, and reports for each simulation
logs/ Weekly reflections (wins, blockers, next goals)
anki/ Exported flashcard decks (optional)
environment.yml Reproducible Python/Conda environment (if using)

*Study Cadence Right Now**  
- **22 h/week:** 10 h weeknights, 12 h weekends.  
- Weekly deliverables: at least one notebook, figure, or simulation log pushed by Sunday.  
- Continuous AI assistance for debugging, literature summarization, and code generation.
